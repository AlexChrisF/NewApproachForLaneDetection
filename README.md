# A new approach for detecting the right lane

This project is a new approach for detecting the lanes.
It's main feature is a region based lane detection, filters add probabilities. 
The point with the hightest probablity in each region is considered a part of lane.

It all runs on a Raspberry 2B at 50fps

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need Matlab 2017a or newer, Simulink with Computer Vision System Toolbox installed

## Run it

You can simply run the simulation by executing the Spurerkennung.slx file
